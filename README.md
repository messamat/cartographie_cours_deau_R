## Abstract
Even the most stringent environmental law cannot  protect a river if its tributaries remain exposed to pollution and other
threats upstream. Excluding a subset of watercourses from legal protection therefore threatens to alter freshwater ecosystems across 
entire river networks and the services they provide, such as drinking water and flood regulation. 
Considerable attention has been devoted to defining the scope of environmental laws protecting watercourses. 
Yet how these definitions are implemented through regulatory mapping, the cartography of waterbodies that legally
qualify as watercourses and are thus protected, has not been examined outside of the United States.
Here, we demonstrate the consequences of regulatory mapping on the extent of river networks that are protected, 
using France as a case study. By assembling the first map of France’s watercourses protected under the Water Law, 
we estimate that a quarter of previously mapped hydrographic segments were excluded from protection and found stark 
geographical variations in the extent of protected ecosystems. Headwater and nonperennial segments are disproportionately 
excluded by 28% compared to their prevalence (67%) in the overall hydrographic network, with potentially far-reaching 
implications for biodiversity and people. We expect regulatory frameworks in most countries to be equally susceptible to 
local interpretation of legal definitions.

## Introduction

This repository includes the portions of the analysis conducted in R, which relies on spatially pre-formatted files.
This analysis workflow needs to be conducted after running the Python code in the 
following repository: https://github.com/messamat/cartographie_cours_deau. 

These scripts are annotated but could be challenging to follow. If you encounter any trouble, please don't hesitate
to contact Mathis L. Messager for comments and clarifications by email or to log an issue in github.

Files needed to run this analysis are either downloaded directly from this or the Python code or were provided by Directions
Departementales des Territoires. Please reach out to Mathis L. Messager for assistance with obtaining these data.
